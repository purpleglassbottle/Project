1. HTML Design for Main Content
2. Create Session Pages and Improve More Features
3. Improve Musicians Pages
4. Improve Login Pages 
5. Improve javasript for the rubrics
a) Your code needs to demonstrate
at least three different events (15 pts)
at least five elements with which user interaction will trigger some event handler (25 pts)
b) Your code needs to demonstrate
at least three ways of selecting elements, each way should be suitable to the task (15 pts)
at least least one selection should return a collection of HTML elements and apply some customized operations on each element (for example, a list of different todo items, and apply different styles based on if the todo item is overdue or not.) (5 pts)
c) Your code needs to demonstrate
at least five complete user interactions facilitated by JS (see explanations above) (25 pts)
understanding of scope (for example, appropriate use of function scope and global scopes for variables, functions, etc.) (5 pts)
d) Dynamic content rendering on the web page from external data, with consistent tags, styles, and behaviors. (similar to the survey rendering process in Lab 9!)
For example, if you have a shopping list, existing items should be rendered from an external data file, and each item should have functioning buttons allowing users to edit or remove it.
